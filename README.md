# Operating-Systems-Codes
This repository is some codes written for Operating Systsems course. PA3 folder contains the contents necessary for running a thread-safe
DNS multi-lookup. There is also C++ code solving disk scheduling algorithms given the request string, starting disk, and disk size.
The process scheduler program takes in the arrival, execution time, and deadline for all processes. It then computes and show the context switches between
processes at a given tick. All these algorithms were written with preemption in mind and round robin incrementing by a given tick amount.
